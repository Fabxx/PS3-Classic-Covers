# Steam Adaptation

Ideal resolutionfor steam is `500x700`, however when using the logo on the left margin, this would receive a cut in the overlay, not fitting properly:

To fix this, the base image it's still `500x700`, but the internal cover has been moved to `439x700`, the PS logo at `40x699`

The left margin is transparent to avoid to have a black bar on the left.

a bit of color correction as also been applied to the PS logo.


You can integrate these covers with the steam rom manager parser i've made in the `GSG` repository.
